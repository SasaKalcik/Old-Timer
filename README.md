# Old-Timer
## An Arduino 3D printed interval timer
Old Timer is a 3D printed wall mountable interval timer, intented for HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training). I wanted to make an affordable and customizable timer for  interval training. 
## Hardware
This project started out with parts from an arduino clone starter kit, 3D printed parts and a 64 x 64 RGB LED matrix. For an affordable minimalistic parts list I would recommend buying the ELEGOO Mega R3 2560 Project Starter Kit and a RGB LED matrix.
Old Timer's guts:
- MEGA 2560 R3 Controller Board
- 64 x 64 RGB LED matrix
- DFPlayer mini MP3 player
- TF-card (DFPlayer supports up to: 32GB)
- 8 Ohm 3 Watt Speaker 
- rotary encoder with push button
- push button
