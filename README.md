# Old-Timer

## 3D printed Arduino based interval timer display
Old Timer is a 3D printed wall mountable interval timer, intented for HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training). This is a DIY-project for a 64x64 RGB LED matrix display with a speaker and an interface, powered by an Arduino microcontroller board.

## Hardware
This project started out with parts from an Arduino starter kit, 3D printed parts and a 64x64 RGB LED matrix. For an affordable minimalistic parts list (without the 3D printed case) I would recommend the following:

- 1 x AC-DC power adapter 5.0 V / 4.0 A  
- 1 x ELEGOO Mega R3 2560 Project Starter Kit 
- 1 x (64x64) RGB LED matrix
- 1 x DFPlayer mini MP3 player
- 1 x TF-card (DFPlayer supports up to: 32 GB)

Complete list of Old Timer's "electronic guts":

- 1 x AC-DC power adapter 5.0 V / 4.0 A  
- 1 x Female DC Threaded Barrel Jack Panel Adapter (or any connector suitable for plug of AC-DC power adapter)
- 1 x MEGA 2560 R3 Controller Board
- 1 x Prototype Shield Board Kit for Arduino Mega
- 1 x (64x64) RGB LED matrix 
- 1 x DFPlayer mini MP3 player
- 1 x TF-card (DFPlayer supports up to: 32 GB)
- 1 x 3 W 8 &Omega; Speaker 
- 1 x rotary encoder with push button
- 1 x mini push button
- 1 x ON/OFF toggle round rocker switch 
- 1 x 1 k&Omega; resistor
- Dupont jumper wires

3D printed case assembly parts:

- 3D printed case parts
- 19 x (M3 x 10 mm) screw bolts 
- 6 x (M4 x 15 mm) screw bolts
- 6 x (M4 9 mm diameter) flat washers 
- 6 x M4 hex nuts
